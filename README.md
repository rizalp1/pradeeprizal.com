This website was designed using the "Simple Markdown Web" framework that I wrote earlier
to make writing very simple websites in markdown format easy. While there are numerous
services that lets you write *.md and convert to html websites, I needed one which would
let me deploy a static website to my own host and without the need to run node.
Essentially, I can even deploy this static website, written entirely in markdown format, on Amazon S3.
